Calcium channel blockers for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,29578611,"Schizophrenia and related disorders affect a sizable proportion of any population. Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment for these disorders. Antipsychotic medications are associated with a variety of adverse effects including tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is a disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region that can be tardive (having a slow or belated onset). Tardive dyskinesia is difficult to treat, despite experimentation with several treatments. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been among these experimental treatments.</AbstractText>: Schizophrenia and related disorders affect a sizable proportion of any population.

Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,29543325,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations of short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated if pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.MAIN RESULTS: We included 38 trials (involving 2543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2295 participants. Many different interventions were studied, and no single intervention was assessed in more than four trials. We extracted data on 18 different comparisons. The risk of bias was high in all trials but one. Trial Sequential Analysis showed imprecision for all comparisons.For benzodiazepine discontinuation, we found a potential benefit of valproate at end of intervention (1 study, 27 participants; risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.03; very low-quality evidence) and of tricyclic antidepressants at longest follow-up (1 study, 47 participants; RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.82; low-quality evidence).We found potentially positive effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; mean difference (MD) -3.10 points, 95% CI -3.51 to -2.69; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -1.00 points, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.87; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -3.57 points, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.80; very low-quality evidence), tricyclic antidepressants (1 study, 38 participants; MD -19.78 points, 95% CI -20.25 to -19.31; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (3 studies, 58 participants; standardised mean difference -0.95, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.19; very low-quality evidence) at end of intervention. However, the positive effect of paroxetine on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms did not persist until longest follow-up (1 study, 54 participants; MD -0.13 points, 95% CI -4.03 to 3.77; very low-quality evidence).The following pharmacological interventions reduced symptoms of anxiety at end of intervention: carbamazepine (1 study, 36 participants; MD -6.00 points, 95% CI -9.58 to -2.42; very low-quality evidence), pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; MD -4.80 points, 95% CI -5.28 to -4.32; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -5.70 points, 95% CI -6.05 to -5.35; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -6.75 points, 95% CI -9.64 to -3.86; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (1 study, 18 participants; MD -1.30 points, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.32; very low-quality evidence).Two pharmacological treatments seemed to reduce the proportion of participants that relapsed to benzodiazepine use: valproate (1 study, 27 participants; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90; very low-quality evidence) and cyamemazine (1 study, 124 participants; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; very low-quality evidence). Alpidem decreased the proportion of participants with benzodiazepine discontinuation (1 study, 25 participants; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2.3 participants; low-quality evidence) and increased the occurrence of withdrawal syndrome (1 study, 145 participants; RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 21.14; NNTH 5.9 participants; low-quality evidence). Likewise, magnesium aspartate decreased the proportion of participants discontinuing benzodiazepines (1 study, 144 participants; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; NNTH 5.8; very low-quality evidence).Generally, adverse events were insufficiently reported. Specifically, one of the flumazenil trials was discontinued due to severe panic reactions.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the low or very low quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes, and the small number of trials identified with a limited number of participants for each comparison, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding pharmacological interventions to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users. Due to poor reporting, adverse events could not be reliably assessed across trials. More randomised controlled trials are required with less risk of systematic errors ('bias') and of random errors ('play of chance') and better and full reporting of patient-centred and long-term clinical outcomes. Such trials ought to be conducted independently of industry involvement."

"Modulatory effects of ketamine, risperidone and lamotrigine on resting brain perfusion in healthy human subjects.",Psychopharmacology,2015,26223493,"RATIONALE: Resting brain perfusion, measured using the MRI-based arterial spin labelling (ASL) technique, is sensitive to detect central effects of single, clinically effective, doses of pharmacological compounds. However, pharmacological interaction experiments, such as the modulation of one drug response in the presence of another, have not been widely investigated using a task-free ASL approach.OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effects of three psychoactive compounds (ketamine, risperidone and lamotrigine), and their interaction, on resting brain perfusion in healthy human volunteers.METHODS: A multivariate Gaussian process classification (GPC) and more conventional univariate analyses were applied. The four pre-infusion conditions for each subject comprised risperidone, lamotrigine and two placebo sessions. The two placebo conditions enabled us to evaluate the classification performance in a test-retest setting, in addition to its performance in distinguishing the active oral drugs from placebo (direct effect on brain perfusion). The post ketamine- or saline-infusion scans allowed the effect of ketamine, and its interaction with risperidone and lamotrigine, on brain perfusion to be characterised.RESULTS: The pseudo-continuous ASL measurements of perfusion were sensitive to the effects of ketamine infusion and risperidone. The GPC captured consistent changes in perfusion across the group and contextualised the univariate changes with a larger pattern of regions contributing to accurate discrimination of ketamine from placebo.CONCLUSIONS: The findings argue against perfusion changes confounding in the previously described evoked BOLD response to ketamine and emphasise the blockade of the NMDA receptor over neuronal glutamate release in determining the perfusion changes induced by ketamine."
Lamotrigine in psychiatric disorders.,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,2013,23945444,"OBJECTIVE: Owing to the prevalence of medication side effects and treatment resistance, prescribers often consider off-label uses of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for the treatment of persistent symptoms. The authors review the available literature on the FDA-approved and non-FDA-approved uses of lamotrigine in adults with psychiatric disorders.DATA SOURCES: We used PubMed, MEDLINE, and a hand search of relevant literature to find studies published between 1990 and 2012 and available in English language. The following keywords were searched: lamotrigine, psychiatric, mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, side effects, and rash.STUDY SELECTION: Data were selected from 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). When RCTs were not available, open-label trials (6), retrospective case reviews (10), and case series (4) were summarized.DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted results of monotherapy and augmentation trials of lamotrigine on primary and secondary outcome measures.RESULTS: Lamotrigine is generally well tolerated, with the best evidence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, particularly in prevention of depressive episodes. In acute bipolar depression, meta-analyses suggested a modest benefit, especially for more severely depressed subjects, with switch rates similar to placebo. In unipolar depression, double-blind RCTs noted benefit on subsets of symptoms and improved response in more severely depressed subjects. Data are limited but promising in borderline personality disorder. Use of lamotrigine in schizophrenia and anxiety disorders has little supportive evidence.CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent. It also has a role in treating acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression, though the latter warrants more research. Data are too limited in other psychiatric disorders to recommend its use at this time."
Randomized controlled study of the T-type calcium channel antagonist MK-8998 for the treatment of acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.,Human psychopharmacology,2013,23532746,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether the T-type calcium channel antagonist MK-8998 was effective in treating acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. After a placebo lead-in, acutely psychotic inpatients with schizophrenia were randomized to 4 weeks of MK-8998 12/16 mg daily (N = 86), olanzapine 10/15 mg daily (N = 47), or placebo (N = 83). The primary efficacy measure was score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).RESULTS: Out of 216 randomized patients, 158 completed the 4-week study: MK-8998 = 58 (67.4%), olanzapine = 38 (80.9%), and placebo = 62 (74.7%). The mean changes from baseline in PANSS score at week 4 for MK-8998 and olanzapine were not significantly different from placebo: MK-8998-placebo difference = -0.6 [95% confidence interval (CI): -7.0, 5.8], p = 0.9; olanzapine-placebo difference = -4.3 [95% CI: -11.7, 3.1), p = 0.3. A responder rate analysis (≥20% improvement from baseline in PANSS score) suggested an advantage of olanzapine over placebo (odds ratio = 2.20 [95% CI: 0.95, 5.09], p = 0.07) but no effect of MK-8998 over placebo (odds ratio = 1.28 [95% CI: 0.62, 2.64], p = 0.5). Treatments were generally well tolerated, but more patients reported adverse events for MK-8998 (47.7%) and olanzapine (48.9%) than placebo (37.3%).CONCLUSIONS: MK-8998 was not effective in treating acutely psychotic inpatients with schizophrenia, as measured by PANSS score at week 4. Because of the limited efficacy of the active comparator, we cannot exclude the possibility that T-type calcium channel antagonists could prove to be effective in schizophrenia."
Lamotrigine augmentation in patients with schizophrenia who show partial response to clozapine treatment.,Schizophrenia research,2012,23217729,"BACKGROUND: Several placebo controlled studies investigating lamotrigine augmentation of clozapine in schizophrenia patients with partial response have shown varying results. The aim of this study was to further investigate the efficacy and safety of this augmentation strategy, and its effect on the glutamatergic system through utilizing mismatch negativity (MMN) component of auditory event related potentials.METHODS: The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine augmentation of clozapine in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized design. Thirty-four patients diagnosed according to DSM-IV schizophrenia criteria and with partial response to clozapine were included. Patients were randomized to 25mg/day of lamotrigine or placebo, gradually increasing up to 200mg/day on the 6th week. The change in psychopathology was assessed with Positive and Negative Syndrome (PANSS), Calgary Depression (CDS) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scales. A neuropsychological test battery was administered and MMN measurements were also obtained at baseline and endpoint. Safety evaluation included physical examination, UKU Side Effect Rating Scale (UKU) assessment and serum drug level measurements.RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two treatment groups in PANSS Positive and General Psychopathology, CDS, neurocognitive test and UKU scores, as well as MMN measurements. PANSS Total, Negative and CGI-S scores showed significant improvement compared to lamotrigine in the placebo group.CONCLUSION: This study did not show any benefit of augmentation of clozapine with lamotrigine in schizophrenia patients with partial response. The need for further investigation of other augmentation strategies of clozapine in partially responsive schizophrenia patients is evident."
Cannabidiol enhances anandamide signaling and alleviates psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.,Translational psychiatry,2012,22832859,"Cannabidiol is a component of marijuana that does not activate cannabinoid receptors, but moderately inhibits the degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide. We previously reported that an elevation of anandamide levels in cerebrospinal fluid inversely correlated to psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, enhanced anandamide signaling let to a lower transition rate from initial prodromal states into frank psychosis as well as postponed transition. In our translational approach, we performed a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of cannabidiol vs amisulpride, a potent antipsychotic, in acute schizophrenia to evaluate the clinical relevance of our initial findings. Either treatment was safe and led to significant clinical improvement, but cannabidiol displayed a markedly superior side-effect profile. Moreover, cannabidiol treatment was accompanied by a significant increase in serum anandamide levels, which was significantly associated with clinical improvement. The results suggest that inhibition of anandamide deactivation may contribute to the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol potentially representing a completely new mechanism in the treatment of schizophrenia."
The effect of pregabalin on sensorimotor gating in 'low' gating humans and mice.,Neuropharmacology,2012,22575075,"Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic compound that binds to α2-δ auxiliary subunit Types 1 and 2 of voltage-gated calcium channels, has been shown to reduce excitatory neurotransmission partially through modulation of glutamatergic signaling. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating impacted by disruption of the glutamatergic system and is reduced in schizophrenia patients. Dysregulation of the glutamatergic system has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here we tested the hypothesis that pregabalin may ameliorate PPI in a model of deficient gating in humans and mice. In study 1, 14 healthy human subjects participated in a within subjects, cross-over study with placebo, 50 mg or 200 mg pregabalin treatment prior to undergoing a PPI task. In study 2, 24 C57BL/6 mice underwent a similar procedure with vehicle, 30 and 100 mg/kg dose treatments. In both studies, subjects were assigned to a &quot;Low&quot; or &quot;High&quot; gating group using a median split procedure based on their PPI performance during placebo/vehicle. Drug effects were then examined across these groups. In humans, pregabalin treatment significantly increased PPI performance in the &quot;low gating&quot; group. In mice, pregabalin treatment significantly increased PPI in the low gating group but reduced PPI in the high gating group. Across species, pregabalin treatment improves PPI in subjects with low gating. These data support further exploration of pregabalin as a potential treatment for disorders characterized by sensorimotor gating deficits and glutamatergic hypersignaling, such as schizophrenia."
Pharmacological augmentation strategies for schizophrenia patients with insufficient response to clozapine: a quantitative literature review.,Schizophrenia bulletin,2011,21422107,"BACKGROUND: When schizophrenia patients have insufficient response to clozapine, pharmacological augmentation is often applied. This meta-analysis summarizes available evidence on efficacy of pharmacological augmentation of clozapine treatment in schizophrenia spectrum disorder.METHODS: Only double-blind randomized controlled studies were included. Primary outcome measure was total symptom severity, and secondary outcome measures were subscores for positive and negative symptoms. Effect sizes were calculated from individual studies and combined to standardized mean differences (Hedges's g).RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies reporting on 15 different augmentations were included. Significant better efficacy than placebo on total symptom severity was observed for lamotrigine, citalopram, sulpiride, and CX516 (a glutamatergic agonist). The positive effect of lamotrigine disappeared after outlier removal. The other positive findings were based on single studies. Significantly better efficacy on positive symptom severity was observed for topiramate and sulpiride. The effect of topiramate disappeared after outlier removal. Results for sulpiride were based on a single randomized controlled trial. Citalopram, sulpiride, and CX516 showed better efficacy for negative symptoms than placebo, all based on single studies.CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for efficacy of clozapine augmentation is currently scarce. Efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate were both dependent on single studies with deviating findings. The effect of citalopram, sulpiride, and CX516 were based on single studies. Thus, despite their popularity, pharmacological augmentations of clozapine are not (yet) demonstrated to be superior to placebo."
Adding lithium or anticonvulsants to antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia: useful strategy or exercise in futility?,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,2009,19573487,
A double-blind randomized trial of mood stabilizer augmentation using lamotrigine and valproate for patients with schizophrenia who are stabilized and partially responsive.,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,2009,19440081,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of mood stabilizer augmentation of an antipsychotic for patients with schizophrenia who are both stabilized and partially responsive.METHOD: Adult patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were enrolled in a 12-week, double-blind randomized trial. Patients were stabilized on an antipsychotic, and dose remained constant. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 adjunctive treatments: (1) with lamotrigine, (2) with divalproex sodium, or (3) with placebo. Efficacy assessments included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, a Demoralization Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression severity and improvement scores. The Lehman quality of life improvement scale was used to assess quality of life and social functioning. Ratings were done at each study visit, including the last visit when they had been tapered off the adjunctive treatment.RESULTS: There were no differences in global outcomes, symptoms, quality of life, or demoralization among the 3 groups. Short-term adverse effects were minimal.CONCLUSIONS: Augmenting antipsychotics with the mood stabilizers of lamotrigine or divalproex sodium for most partially responsive patients with chronic schizophrenia did not seem to be a useful treatment strategy for improving the residual symptoms. The small sample size limits firm conclusions."
Is flunarizine a long-acting oral atypical antipsychotic? A randomized clinical trial versus haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia.,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,2009,19192440,"Flunarizine is known as a nonspecific calcium channel blocker that has been used for decades for the treatment of migraine, vertigo, and cognitive deficits related to cerebrovascular disorders.

The efficacy of lamotrigine in clozapine-resistant schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Schizophrenia research,2009,19186030,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine is the drug of choice for patients with unsatisfactory response to routine antipsychotic treatment. Polypharmacy is widely used among patients having clozapine-resistant schizophrenia, although no solid evidence exists for any effective augmentation therapy for this patient population. We aimed to study the efficacy of lamotrigine in the treatment of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia.METHOD: We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane PsiTri database, the Website of metaRegister of Controlled Trials, including NIH ClinicalTrials.gov, and a clinical trial register by the manufacturer of lamotrigine (GlaxoSmithKline). All randomized placebo-controlled studies on patients receiving clozapine were included in the analysis. The primary outcome measure was a total score for symptoms of psychosis, and the secondary outcome measures were scores for positive and negative symptoms of psychosis. For continuous and binary data, standardized mean differences (SMD), and odds ratios (OR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated, respectively.RESULTS: Five trials with 10 to 24 weeks duration and total of 161 randomized clozapine patients were included in the meta-analysis. Lamotrigine was superior to placebo augmentation in both the primary outcome measure (SMD 0.57, 95%CI 0.25-0.89, p&lt;0.001; OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.09-0.43, p&lt;0.001; NNT 4, 95%CI 3-6) and secondary outcome measures (SMD 0.34, 95%CI 0.02-0.65 for positive symptoms, SMD 0.43, 95%CI 0.11-0.75 for negative symptoms).CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that lamotrigine augmentation may be an effective treatment for patients with clozapine-resistant schizophrenia. A substantial proportion of these most severely ill patients appeared to obtain clinically meaningful benefit from this combination treatment."
[The use of nifedipine as a corrector of extrapyramidal side-effects of classical neuroleptics].,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova,2008,18577931,"The aim of the article was to study efficacy and safety of nifedipine in the correction of extrapyramidal side-effects emerged during conventional neuroleptics therapy. Fifty-one patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia received haloperidol in combination with nifedipine (25 patients) or haloperidol only (26 patients) during 26 weeks. Dynamics of psychopathological symptoms and extrapyramidal disorders were measured with PANSS, CGI, BARS, SARS and AIMS. Patients receiving haloperidol in combination with nifedipine had the lower AIMS scores indicating appearances of dyskinesia and less marked (on the trend to statistical significance) SARS scores measuring parkinsonian symptoms as compared to patients receiving monotherapy with haloperidol. The administration of nifedipine in combination with haloperidol did not reduce the therapeutic efficacy of the latter and did not lead to the increase of side-effects. The data obtained suggest that nifedipine may be used as a perspective corrector of extrapyramidal disorders caused by classical neuroleptics."
Lamotrigine as add-on therapy in schizophrenia: results of 2 placebo-controlled trials.,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,2007,18004124,"OBJECTIVE: : Lamotrigine previously was found to attenuate ketamine-induced behavioral changes and, in 2 placebo-controlled trials, to improve psychosis when added to antipsychotic medication. We sought to evaluate the potential role of lamotrigine augmentation in schizophrenia patients resistant to atypical antipsychotic medication.METHODS: : Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 12-week, parallel-group trials were conducted to compare flexibly dosed lamotrigine (100-400 mg/d) with placebo as add-on treatment in schizophrenia patients with stable, residual psychotic symptoms. The primary end point was changed in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at week 12.RESULTS: : Two hundred seventeen patients were enrolled in study 1 and 212 in study 2; completion rates in the intent-to-treat samples were 71% and 74%, respectively, and did not differ between treatment groups. Overall, mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores improved in both studies and did not differ between treatment groups. In study 1, the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms total score and Clinical Global Impression improved more with placebo than with lamotrigine; in study 2, the cognitive composite score improved more with lamotrigine than with placebo.CONCLUSIONS: : Results from these 2 studies do not support the use of lamotrigine as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotics in patients with refractory psychosis. It is unclear why positive results from previous lamotrigine trials were not replicated. The positive effect of lamotrigine on cognition in one trial, while of uncertain significance, may merit further study."
Atypical antipsychotics in bipolar disorder: systematic review of randomised trials.,BMC psychiatry,2007,17705840,"BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used for treatment of mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and considered to have fewer extrapyramidal effects than older antipsychotics.METHODS: We examined efficacy in randomised trials of bipolar disorder where the presenting episode was either depression, or manic/mixed, comparing atypical antipsychotic with placebo or active comparator, examined withdrawals for any cause, or due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, and combined all phases for adverse event analysis. Studies were found through systematic search (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), and data combined for analysis where there was clinical homogeneity, with a special reference to trial duration.RESULTS: In five trials (2,206 patients) participants presented with a depressive episode, and in 25 trials (6,174 patients) the presenting episode was manic or mixed. In 8-week studies presenting with depression, quetiapine and olanzapine produced significantly better rates of response and symptomatic remission than placebo, with NNTs of 5-6, but more adverse event withdrawals (NNH 12). With mania or mixed presentation atypical antipsychotics produced significantly better rates of response and symptomatic remission than placebo, with NNTs of about 5 up to six weeks, and 4 at 6-12 weeks, but more adverse event withdrawals (NNH of about 22) in studies of 6-12 weeks. In comparisons with established treatments, atypical antipsychotics had similar efficacy, but significantly fewer adverse event withdrawals (NNT to prevent one withdrawal about 10). In maintenance trials atypical antipsychotics had significantly fewer relapses to depression or mania than placebo or active comparator. In placebo-controlled trials, atypical antipsychotics were associated with higher rates of weight gain of &gt;or=7% (mainly olanzapine trials), somnolence, and extrapyramidal symptoms. In active controlled trials, atypical antipsychotics were associated with lower rates of extrapyramidal symptoms, but higher rates of weight gain and somnolence.CONCLUSION: Atypical antipsychotics are effective in treating both phases of bipolar disorder compared with placebo, and as effective as established drug therapies. Atypical antipsychotics produce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms, but weight gain is more common (with olanzapine). There is insufficient data confidently to distinguish between different atypical antipsychotics."
"The effect of lamotrigine augmentation of clozapine in a sample of treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.",Schizophrenia research,2007,17383857,"Based on the evidence that lamotrigine added to clozapine in refractory schizophrenic patients has reported promising results, the present 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial had the aim to explore the efficacy of lamotrigine add-on pharmacotherapy on clinical symptomatology and cognitive functioning in a sample of treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients receiving clozapine. After clinical and neurocognitive assessments patients were randomly allocated to receive, in a double-blind design, either up to 200 mg/day of lamotrigine or a placebo. A final sample of fifty-one patients completed the study. The results obtained indicate that lamotrigine added to stable clozapine treatment showed a beneficial effect on the negative, positive and general psychopathological symptomatology in a sample of treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. Regarding cognitive functions, improvement was observed in some explored areas, such as attentional resistance to interference, verbal fluency and executive functioning. The findings provide evidence that lamotrigine augmentation of clozapine treatment is well tolerated and may be proposed as an effective therapeutic strategy to improve outcome in treatment-resistant schizophrenia."
"The efficacy of the dopamine D2/D3 antagonist tiapride in maintaining abstinence: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 299 alcohol-dependent patients.",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,2006,17076934,"In this investigation, the hypothesis was tested whether the selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist tiapride is effective in maintaining abstinence after detoxification in alcohol-dependent patients. The rationale of the study was based on the relevance of the dopaminergic system for addictive behaviour as well as some preliminary studies. A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted. A total of 299 detoxified alcohol-dependent patients (ICD-10: F10.2) received either tiapride (300 mg/d) or placebo over a 24-wk study period. Subjects with severe comorbid psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome were excluded. Primary outcome variable was the time to first relapse with relapse defined as any alcohol consumption after detoxification. Data analysis was done with Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test (one-sided, p&lt;0.05). Tiapride was not superior to placebo in maintaining abstinence. The time to first relapse was 71 d in the tiapride group and 92 d in the placebo group (log-rank test, p=0.9895). Relapse rate was higher in the intervention group (54.4%) than in the control group (40.7%). Like the dopamine antagonist flupenthixol, tiapride was not effective in maintaining alcohol abstinence. Regarding the high success rate in the placebo group the influence of psychosocial treatment in studies investigating drug effects on the course of alcohol dependence has to be considered."
Lamotrigine for schizophrenia.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2006,17054266,"BACKGROUND: Treating the 20-30% of people with schizophrenia whose symptoms are resistant to treatment can be problematic. Adding lamotrigine to ongoing antipsychotic treatment has shown to be of benefit in preliminary studies.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of adjuvant lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2006) and inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all clinical randomised trials comparing lamotrigine with placebo or other antipsychotic augmentation strategies.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).MAIN RESULTS: We found five relevant trials (total n=537), but no usable data on service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment or economic outcomes. Overall, reporting of data was poor. Those data we were able to use suggested that equal proportions of people allocated lamotrigine or placebo had no global response (n=208, 1 RCT, RR 1.06 CI 0.73 to 1.54). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of people whose mental state did not improve (n=297, 3 RCT, RR 1.26 CI 0.81 to 1.97). There was, however, a significant reduction in the PANSS total scores (n=67, 2 RCT, WMD -16.88 CI -8.57 to -25.18, p=0.0001), positive symptom sub-scale scores (n=65, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.10 CI -8.86 to -1.34) and negative symptom sub-scale scores (n=67, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.25, CI -7.07 to -3.43). Most cognitive measures showed no differences (n=329, 2 RCTs, RR not attaining BACS composite score of 0.5 1.10 CI 0.59 to 2.04). The proportion of participants leaving studies was about 25% at 12 weeks (n=537, 5 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.71 to 1.29). The lamotrigine group did experience the outcome of any adverse effects significantly more frequent than people allocated placebo (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19 CI 1.02 to 1.38, NNH 10 CI 5 to 90). Among the many effects listed, only nausea was found to be significantly more (9%) in the lamotrigine group compared with placebo (n=465, 3 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 1.05 to 4.88).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for use of lamotrigine as an adjuvant for people with schizophrenia is not robust and large well-designed, conducted and reported real-world randomised trials are needed to determine its place in everyday clinical practice."
Non-neuroleptic catecholaminergic drugs for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2006,16437424,"BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disabling movement disorder associated with the prolonged use of neuroleptic medication. Several strategies have been examined in the treatment of TD. Currently, however, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of these drugs in TD and they have been associated with many side effects. One particular strategy would be to use pharmaceutical agents which are known to influence the catecholaminergic system at various junctures.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether catecholaminergic drugs for people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses are associated with a reduction in neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 1996), Biological Abstracts (1982-1995), EMBASE (1980-1995), LILACS (1982-1996), MEDLINE (1966-1995) and PsycLIT (1974-1995). We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register again in December 2002 and September 2005. We also searched references of all relevant studies for further trial citations and contacted principal authors of trials.SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected studies if they were randomised controlled trials focusing on people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who also suffered from neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia. We compared the use of catecholaminergic interventions versus placebo or no intervention.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated the random effects, relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).MAIN RESULTS: We excluded 20 studies, mainly due to an inability to extract data from the first arm of the study crossover. One included study has shown that patients on placebo were no more likely to leave the study early than those on tiapride (n=24). The other included study (n=35) also reported equivocal data (RR 5.28 CI 0.3 to 102.6) for leaving the study early when participants were randomised to either celiprolol or placebo. However, in both studies, sample size was limited.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been a large amount of research in this area, most studies were excluded due to inherent problems in the nature of their crossover designs. Usually data are not reported before the crossover and the nature of TD and its likely response to treatments makes it imprudent to use this data. The review provides little usable information for service users or providers and more well designed and reported studies are indicated."
Placebo-controlled trial of lamotrigine added to conventional and atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenia.,Biological psychiatry,2004,15364042,"BACKGROUND: Lamotrigine, a novel anticonvulsant drug having modulatory effects on glutamatergic neurotransmission, improves mood and cognition parameters in bipolar disorder. Recent studies suggest that when added to clozapine, lamotrigine treatment may result in significant positive symptoms reductions in schizophrenia. Similar effects were not observed in an open trial in which lamotrigine was used as adjuvant to nonclozapine antipsychotics.METHODS: Thirty-eight treatment-resistant schizophrenia inpatients receiving conventional and atypical antipsychotics enrolled in a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which they were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive adjuvant treatment with lamotrigine, gradually titrated to a 400 mg/day dose, or placebo. Of these, 31 completed the trial. Measures of clinical efficacy and side effects were determined every other week. Serum levels of amino acids were assessed at the beginning and end of the study.RESULTS: In primary last observation carried forward analysis, no statistically significant between-group differences were observed; however, the completers' analyses revealed that lamotrigine treatment resulted in significant (p &lt; or = .05) reductions in positive and general psychopathology symptoms, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. No significant differences in lamotrigine effects were noted between conventional versus atypical antipsychotics. Lamotrigine treatment was well tolerated, and glutamate serum levels remained stable throughout the study.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings 1) support the hypothesis that lamotrigine adjuvant treatment may improve positive symptoms and general psychopathology in schizophrenia, 2) suggest that beneficial effects may be achieved when lamotrigine is added to both conventional and atypical antipsychotics, and 3) warrant additional, larger scale trials."
Calcium channel blockers for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2004,14973950,"BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia is a disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region often caused by antipsychotic drugs. A wide range of strategies has been used to help manage tardive dyskinesia and, for people who are unable to have their antipsychotic medication stopped or substantially changed, the calcium-channel blocking group of drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) has been suggested as a useful adjunctive treatment.OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of calcium-channel blocker drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) for treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses.SEARCH STRATEGY: We updated previous searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (1982-2000), Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2000), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (November 2000), EMBASE (1980-2000), LILACS (1982-2000), MEDLINE (1966-2000), PsycLIT (1974-2000), and SCISEARCH by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (September 2003). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations and contacted authors of trials.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials comparing calcium-channel blockers to placebo or no intervention for people with both tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or serious mental illness.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were to have been independently extracted and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were to have been calculated using a random effects model, and, where possible, the number needed to treat calculated. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were to have been calculated for continuous data.MAIN RESULTS: No trials were included. We excluded fourteen studies; eight were not randomised, one did not use calcium channel blockers and five small, randomised, studies reported no usable data.S CONCLUSIONS: The effects of calcium-channel blockers for antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia are unknown. Their use is experimental and should only be given in the context of well designed randomised studies."
Lamotrigine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial.,Biological psychiatry,2003,14643092,"BACKGROUND: There is no evidence from randomized, controlled trials that demonstrate effectiveness for any pharmacological treatment in clozapine-resistant schizophrenia. Since the introduction of chlorpromazine, all antipsychotics with proven efficacy on positive symptoms have been dopamine antagonists, but recent experimental data suggest that ketamine-induced positive schizophreniform symptoms in healthy subjects can be controlled by a glutamate antagonist lamotrigine. The hypothesis tested was that lamotrigine is more effective than placebo in the treatment of positive schizophrenic symptoms when combined with clozapine.METHODS: Thirty-four hospitalized treatment-resistant patients having chronic schizophrenia participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week, crossover trial where 200 mg/day lamotrigine was gradually added to their ongoing clozapine treatment. Clinical assessments were made by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale at the beginning and end of each treatment period.RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analysis, lamotrigine treatment was more effective in reducing positive (effect size.7, p =.009) and general psychopathological (effect size.6, p =.030) symptoms, whereas no improvement was observed in negative symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence from a randomized controlled trial of an effective pharmacological treatment with an anticonvulsant agent in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and indicate that both positive and general psychopathological symptoms in patients with schizophrenia can be controlled by a drug that is not a dopamine antagonist. The results are in line with previous experimental data suggesting that excessive glutamate neurotransmission contributes to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia."
Attenuation of ketamine effects by nimodipine pretreatment in recovering ethanol dependent men: psychopharmacologic implications of the interaction of NMDA and L-type calcium channel antagonists.,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2001,11750186,"Ketamine blocks the calcium channel associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. It has transient behavioral effects in healthy humans that resemble aspects of schizophrenia, dissociative disorders, and ethanol intoxication. Ethanol is an antagonist of both NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) and it has minimal psychotogenic activity in humans. A double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted that evaluated whether pretreatment with the L-type VSCC antagonist, nimodipine, 90 mg D, modulated ketamine response (bolus 0.26 mg/kg, infusion of 0.65 mg/kg/hr) in 26 ethanol-dependent inpatients who were sober for at least one month prior to testing. This study found that nimodipine reduced the capacity of ketamine to induce psychosis, negative symptoms, altered perception, dysphoria, verbal fluency impairment, and learning deficits. Nimodipine improved memory function, but had no other intrinsic behavioral activity in this patient group. Nimodipine pretreatment attenuated the perceived similarity of ketamine effects to ethanol as well as ketamine-induced euphoria and sedation. However, nimodipine did not reduce the stimulant effects of ketamine. These data suggest that antagonism of L-type VSCCs attenuates the behavioral effects of NMDA antagonists in humans. They support the continued evaluation of nimodipine in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. They also suggest that drugs, such as ethanol, that combine NMDA and L-type VSCC antagonism may have enhanced tolerability without attenuation of their stimulant effects."
Calcium channel blockers for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2001,11279683,"BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a potentially disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region often caused by use of neuroleptic drugs. A wide range of strategies has been used to help manage TD and, for those who are unable to have their antipsychotic medication stopped or substantially changed, the calcium-channel blocking group of drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) has been suggested as a useful adjunctive treatment.OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of calcium-channel blocker drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) for treatment of neuroleptic-induced TD in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses.SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982-2000), Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2000), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials (November 2000), EMBASE (1980-2000), LILACS (1982-2000), MEDLINE (1966-2000), PsycLIT (1974-2000), and SCISEARCH were undertaken. References of all identified studies were searched for relevant citations. Principal authors of trials were contacted.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials comparing calcium-channel blockers to placebo or no intervention for people with both TD and schizophrenia or serious mental illness were reliably selected.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were to have been independently extracted and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were to have been calculated using a random effects model, and, where possible, the number needed to treat calculated. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were to have been calculated for continuous data.MAIN RESULTS: No trials were included. Seven studies were excluded; five were not randomised and two small randomised crossover studies provided no usable data. Two more small randomised controlled trials await assessment. The authors have been contacted for relevant information.S CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available information, no confident statement can be made about the effectiveness of calcium-channel blockers for treating people with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia. Before evaluation of these drugs in larger randomised controlled trials, clinicians should carefully weigh up the possible benefits against their potential adverse effects."
Attenuation of the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine with lamotrigine: support for hyperglutamatergic effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists.,Archives of general psychiatry,2e3,10711913,"BACKGROUND: The cognitive, behavioral, and mood effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, have been used to study the effects of NMDA receptor dysfunction. Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Preclinical studies indicate that some ketamine effects may be mediated through increased glutamate release. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lamotrigine, a drug reported to inhibit glutamate release, will reduce the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine in humans.METHOD: Healthy subjects (n = 16) completed 4 test days involving the administration of lamotrigine, 300 mg by mouth, or placebo 2 hours prior to administration of ketamine (0.26 mg/kg by intravenous bolus and 0.65 mg/kg per hour by intravenous infusion) or placebo in a randomized order under double-blind conditions. Behavioral and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and after administration of the medications.RESULTS: Lamotrigine significantly decreased ketamine-induced perceptual abnormalities as assessed by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (P&lt;.001); positive symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive symptoms subscale (P&lt;.001); negative symptoms as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale negative symptoms subscale (P&lt;.05); and learning and memory impairment as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (P&lt;.05). However, lamotrigine increased the immediate mood-elevating effects of ketamine (P&lt;.05).CONCLUSIONS: Glutamate release-inhibiting drugs may reduce the hyperglutamatergic consequences of NMDA receptor dysfunction implicated in the pathophysiologic processes of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Further study is needed."
"Effects of nifedipine, a calcium channel antagonist, on cognitive function in schizophrenic patients with tardive dyskinesia.",Clinical neuropharmacology,1997,9260735,"We examined whether nifedipine, a calcium channel antagonist, added to a stable regimen of neuroleptic medication would affect cognition in patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had tardive dyskinesia. Fifteen patients with tardive dyskinesia were treated with nifedipine (60 mg daily) or matching placebo for 4 weeks and then were crossed over from nifedipine to placebo or from placebo to nifedipine for another 4 weeks. At the end of each 4-week phase of the study, the patients performed a rotary pursuit test of procedural learning and a dementia scale assessing general cognitive abilities. Nifedipine improved performance in the rotary pursuit test and conceptual abilities in the dementia scale compared with placebo, but only for patients who first were exposed to the tests during the placebo condition. These results provide preliminary evidence that calcium channel antagonists might enhance learning and memory in schizophrenic patients with tardive dyskinesia."
Nilvadipine is effective for chronic schizophrenia in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. off.,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,1996,8959468,"We investigated the efficacy of nilvadipine, a calcium channel inhibitor, for psychiatric symptoms and tardive dyskinesia in 30 patients with chronic schizophrenia in a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study. The total scores of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale decreased significantly when the patients were on nilvadipine compared with placebo. Improvement was particularly significant in emotional withdrawal and uncooperativeness. Nilvadipine was not effective, however, for tardive dyskinesia. No adverse effects, such as hypotension, occurred."
A clinical trial of nifedipine in schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia.,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",1991,1686106,"Effects of the dihydropyridine calcium channel inhibitor nifedipine on chronic schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia were studied in an 8-week double-blind crossover trial. Four of the ten patients had tardive dyskinesia, and three of these were not receiving neuroleptics. No effects on symptoms of chronic schizophrenia were found using Psychiatric Symptom Assessment Scale ratings. In the four patients with tardive dyskinesia, an average improvement in total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores of 57% was observed. These data suggest that dihydropyridine calcium channel inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenic patients."

Antipsychotic effects of verapamil in schizophrenia.,The Hillside journal of clinical psychiatry,1987,3323023,"The antipsychotic effects of verapamil were tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in 18 patients who met Research Diagnostic Criteria for acute schizophrenia. The antipsychotic effect of verapamil as measured by the Bunney-Hamburg Global Rating Scale were equal to those of haloperidol. Both verapamil and haloperidol were superior to placebo in decreasing psychotic symptoms. The results indicate that verapamil may have clinical utility in the treatment of schizophrenia."
